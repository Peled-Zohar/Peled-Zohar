# Hi, I’m Zohar

I've been working as a software developer since 1999, using multiple languages and frameworks.  
Throughout my career I've learned and experienced multiple technologies, design patterns and architectire paradigms,  
and I'm still exceited to learn cool new tricks.

Here you can find a small substed of a few of the things I've developed on my own time,  
be it as a way of learning new things or as a way of helping my self and others to work more efficiently. 

I also maintain a (not very active) Stackoverflow account and write a technical blog on my spare time, called [What The # Do I Know?](https://zoharpeled.wordpress.com/).

I hope at least some of you will benefit from at least some of these repositories or from some of my blog posts.

If you wish to contact me, Please email me at peled.zohar@gmail.com.

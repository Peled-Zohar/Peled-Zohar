# Hi, I’m Zohar

I've been working as a software developer since 1999, using multiple languages and frameworks.  
Throughout my career I've learned and experienced multiple technologies, design patterns and architectire paradigms,  
and I'm still exceited to learn cool new tricks.

Here you can find a few of the things I've developed in my spare time,  
be it as a way of learning new things or as a way of helping my self and others to work more efficiently. 

I also maintain a (not very active) [Stackoverflow account](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3094533/zohar-peled) 
and write a technical blog, called [What The # Do I Know?](https://zoharpeled.wordpress.com/). (also published in [Dev.To](https://dev.to/peledzohar)).

I hope at least some of you will benefit from at least some of these repositories or from some of my blog posts.

Feel free to contact me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zohar-peled/) or email me at peled.zohar(AT)gmail.com.
